Here's a sample of 10 Romanian songs I enjoy, feel free to ping me if you want more of this stuff. Most of them have a comment in there with the lyrics, if you feel like translating them online.

- [Silent Strike - Frunzișoară](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wezDz-QDT8)

Pure instrumental, beautifully blends traditional motifs with electronic. Means tiny leaf.

- [Alternosfera - Nepoata lui Gagarin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqoiEXn8dkY)

Awesome Romanian/Moldavian rock band. Means Gagarin's granddaughter.

- [Deliric & Silent Strike - Ambrozie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIREXhylSVY)

Silent again, this time with one of the best rappers around. Means ambrosia.

- [Subcarpați - Oamenii sunt încă frumoși](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3nGRyn1-vg)

Heavier on traditional motifs from a group exploring how those fit in with rap. Means people are still beautiful.

- [Mihail - Dorul mă ia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAdthtQaoLE)

Jazzy rock? So peaceful and melancholic somehow. Literally means the feeling of missing you grabs me.

- [FiRMA - Tot ce va fi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkkWN3gm6pg)

Some sort of melodic rock. Means all that will be.

- [COMA feat. Sunetele Pădurilor - Cel mai frumos loc de pe pământ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AwSkDQQxs)

Sunetele Pădurilor simply means the sounds of the forests, it's not another band. Means the most beautiful place on Earth.

- [Via Dacă - Paparudă](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmle3H-Oi8k)

Traditional motifs galore. Refers to some Balkan legend of a girl calling on rain.

- [byron - Cu capul în nori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLhjo-ahDb0)

Upbeat rock. Means with the head in the clouds.

- [Frate Gheorghe - Bună Ion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1rjx0pbQrE)

Some raggae, why not? Means hello John. The translation is hilarious.
