## thoughtware

Tools for thought (or _thoughtware_) are tools which expand the range
of what and how people can think. Building tools for thought (or engaging in
_thoughtware engineering_) is the process of creating and recursively
making use of such tools. There are countless approaches to this, but I'm
focusing on creating composable building blocks which amplify basic
cognitive functions. In this, I'm trying to lay the groundwork for
tomorrow's cognitive infrastructure. And yes, I made half of those terms up.

## present & future

- a fluid medium for storing, relating, and surfacing thoughts.
- a lifelong compass for optimally navigating worldviews.
- an IDE for synthesizing belief systems.
- a recommendation system for antifragile learning.
- an evolutionary pressure cooker for mental models.
- a growth agent for shared understanding.
