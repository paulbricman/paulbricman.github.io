## infinite skills

While my professional focus is on building tools which extend human thought, I also care about cultivating a balanced set of skills in other areas of my life. To that end, I'm making use of [infinite skills](/reflections/infinite-skills), a piece of lifestyle design which brings immediate short-term structure to broad long-term goals. The ones which I'm currently cultivating are listed below, in an attempt to provide accountability.

- **[artisanry](/artisanry)**: creating artifacts using analog materials

```haskell
x = [d | d <- map (create100ArtifactsUsing) [Paper, Yarn..]]
```

- **[multilingualism](/reflections/logogram-alchemy)**: speaking foreign languages

```haskell
x = [d | d <- map (getB2In) [Mandarin, Hebrew..]]
```

- **athleticism**: gaining better control and awareness of my body via [short programs](https://www.darebee.com/programs.html)

```haskell
x = [d | d <- map (followProgram) [AgeOfPandora, Pathfinder..]]
```
