## bookshelf

Those are the books I've read at least in part since the somewhat
arbitrary moment of getting a reMarkable tablet, as it marked a big change
in my reading setup. Even if I'm reading on e-ink, I love to wander
around physical libraries in search for titles. I'm reading for three
main reasons: to be inspired, to be mindblown, and to be entertained. Bold
entries are all-time favorites.
