## contact

- **discord:** \<first name\> \<last name\> # 2527

I have no Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, or Linkedin accounts. I reply in more depth by email, and prefer to keep Discord for casual banter. I check both once a day.

The easiest ways to get future updates on my work is through the [reflections RSS feed](/reflections/feed.xml) (for new articles) and the [thoughtware RSS feed](/thoughtware/feed.xml) (for new tools specifically). If you want a monthly executive summary on what happened on the thoughtware stack and what will happen next, consider supporting me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/paulbricman).
