I have no Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, or Linkedin accounts. Just to be clear, this is not an attempt to [work with the door closed](https://youtu.be/a1zDuOPkMSw?t=1099). On the contrary, I'm extremely grateful for the people who spare a bit of their valuable time to reach out and send both praise and criticism through. Having long-form calls with Internet strangers holding bold opinions about human-computer interaction is one of the most exciting parts of the day! Rather, my absence from social media simply reflects my frustration with current user-misaligned platforms.

On a related note, I've recently enabled [comment threads](/reflections/representational-resources) on both reflections and thoughtware write-ups, as an effort to create a transparent space for holding meaningful conversations connected to specific works. Please consider using a public comment section before sending a private message, whenever possible.

The easiest way to get future updates on my work is through the [reflections RSS feed](/reflections/feed.xml) (for new articles) and the [thoughtware RSS feed](/thoughtware/feed.xml) (for new tools specifically). If you want a monthly executive summary on what happened on the thoughtware stack and what will happen next, consider supporting me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/paulbricman).
