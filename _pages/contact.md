You know how the users of an operating system have different rights to access system resources, with the admin or root user usually having full access? As I'm valuing my attention quite a lot, I'm experimenting with a similar scheme for managing my resources of time, energy, and attention. I call this the Exogeneous Attention Protocol (EAP). Essentially, it's a scheme for granting different people in my life different levels of access to my attention, allowing specific demands of time and energy. Naturally, it only constrains externally initiated requests (therefore, _exogeneous_).

|          | permissions                                            | target            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **EAP1** | email checked weekly                                   | random internauts |
| **EAP2** | email checked daily, weekend calls within office hours | collaborators     |
| **EAP3** | SMS, phone calls, Signal calls outside working hours   | family, friends   |
| **EAP4** | SMS, phone calls, Signal calls outside deep work hours | SO                |

<br/>

The permissions are cumulative, the default is EAP1, and the management of all this scheme is managed through a handful of automated filters.

Finally, here's my actual email (most likely checked weekly):
