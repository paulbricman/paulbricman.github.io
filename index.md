## Paul Bricman (disambiguation)

This is a disambiguation page for my online presence. I'm using it as a
common thread which weaves together various fragments of my identity into a
unified whole. A digital mozaic of my ambitions and obsessions, interests
and hobbies. That said, it's a mozaic that's slowly shifting over time,
defined by the emergent pattern, rather than individual fragments.
Essentially the result of a 20-year-old trying to orient himself and enjoy
the process.
