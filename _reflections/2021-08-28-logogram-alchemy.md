## logogram alchemy

At some point in middle school, my classmates and I were obsessed with a mobile game called Alchemy. The rules are simple. You start out with four "primordial" elements (water, fire, earth, and air), and you have to combine them into new ones by placing them together on the canvas. Newly obtained elements can then again be mixed with old ones, resulting in yet other elements. I listed a handful of such reactions below, but the original game has [hundreds of them](https://littlealchemygame.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Elements).

> boat = water + wood
>
> book = paper + story
>
> cheese = milk + time
>
> flashlight = tool + light
>
> ice = water + cold

As you mix and match elements in an attempt to "discover" all of them, you gradually internalize the semantics of the Alchemy universe. For instance, you get to understand a book as a blend between paper and story. You learn that in Alchemy, ice is defined as a mixture of water and cold. Even if the thrill of the game is to identify elements which react with one another, the gratification of discovery is inevitably accompanied by a surprising mental model.

After starting learning Chinese a couple months ago, it didn't take long to recognize the same Alchemy-like mixing mechanic. Chinese words can be combined as raw elements in order to synthesize new ones. Even if words are also made from smaller pieces (e.g. preffixes, suffixes, affixes, roots) in all the other languages I've dabbled in before, it feels radically different in Chinese. The raw elements feel so much more versatile and reactive. So much meaning lies dormant in a handful of careful strokes, it feels like they're soaked in it. In the limit, as there are no word delimitations in day-to-day writing, whole sentences feel like rare elements obtained through long converging chains of semantic reactions. Chinese feels much closer to Alchemy than to any language I've seen before:

> 电脑 (computer) = 电 (electricity) + 脑 (brain)
>
> 老师 (teacher) = 老 (old) + 师 (master)
>
> 家人 (family) = 家 (home) + 人 (person)
>
> 公园 (park) = 公 (public) + 园 (garden)
>
> 好 (good) = 女 (woman) + 子 (child)

After digging around a bit more, I learned that Chinese is classified as an analytical language, as opposed to an agglutinative one. Those terms beautifully capture the dichotomy hinted at above. Analysis is the study of how parts give rise to wholes, which closely matches the style of reasoning required for learning Chinese. In contrast, agglutination is the process of stitching things together, which in the linear medium of language, takes the form of chained morphemes which have to be dissected sequentially.

Even if the Alchemy-like nature of analytical languages is an intriguing topic on its own, what I find even more captivating is how Chinese culture leaks through and permeates the language through the combinations. Whole packs of mental models, ways of conceptualizing the world, are baked into the very fabric of the language, just as was the case in Alchemy. The very way of refering to a computer makes use of the analogy of the electric brain. A family consists of the people at home. Allegedly, people of ancient China conceived of good as having a wife and a child. The language is as much an artifact as it is a carrier of the ideology, and it's fascinating.

To better understand why this happens, a detour to early AI might be informative. Expert systems faced a choice between relying on forward-chaining and backward-chaining. Forward-chaining means extending your knowledge as much as possible, trying to derive facts hoping that you'll eventually derive the target. Backward-chaining refers to reasoning back from the target to what might prove it true or false. Forward-chaining is the stuff of Alchemy and fine-grained Chinese. However, when we conceptualize a thing, we start from there backwards. Essentially, they're closely related, establishing the duality further.

different backends?
