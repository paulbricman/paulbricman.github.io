## Background

Cognitive enhancement aims to expand the range of ways in which people can think. An instrumental goal in achieving this is getting an accurate picture of the user's state of mind. If you know what stage they're in when solving a problem, you can offer tailored help at superhuman speeds. If you know what idea they're considering, you can map its geometry and suggest refinements in real time. Aid memory recall on detected cues, automatically prune game trees, look for answers to pondered questions. The value of tight feedback loops pops up frequently in discussions ranging from flow states to embodied cognition. To offer tight feedback, you need an accurate representation of what it is you're giving feedback to.

One might argue that users could simply provide this information themselves. But for all the richness of typing and tapping, there are just so many bits flowing through. Bandwidth isn't the only shortcoming of traditional human-computer interfaces. Even if interfaces enabled users to express themselves effectively, there's just so much of our thought process we can be aware of. The textbook example is being able to read words but not being aware of edge detection in early visual areas. Metzinger brings up evolutionary reasons for perception, among other cognitive functions, to be transparent. If we wouldn't *see through them*, the sheer volume of information would overwhelm us. Evolution might have engineered blindspots into our awareness.

Introspection being suboptimal for probing mental states was already part of the standard behaviorist rhetoric from half a century ago. Behaviorism aside, we now have instruments which help us get glimpses of the inner workings of the black box. A host of neuroimaging methods have been entertaining researchers for decades. However, no single neuroimaging technique is perfect.

In cognitive neuroscience circles, thought is now universally believed to be realized as neural activity.
