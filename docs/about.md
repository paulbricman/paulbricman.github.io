# Colophon

1. This site uses a modified version of [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs), an open source theme served by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), an open source static site generator.

2. It runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but I'm planning on migrating it to [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/), an open source distributed file system.

3. It uses [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk), an open licence self-hosted font.
