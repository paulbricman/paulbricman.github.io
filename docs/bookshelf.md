# Bookshelf

Those are the books I've read at least in part since the somewhat arbitrary moment of getting a [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com/), as it marked a big change in my reading setup (which is very similar to [this one](https://notebook.wesleyac.com/how-to-pirate-ebooks/)). I'm reading books for three main reasons: 
- ✨ **to be inspired**
- 💡 **to be mindblown**
- 🍿 **to be entertained**

The emojis indicate books which I've found particularly inspiring, mindblowing, or entertaining. Bold entries are all-time favorites.
