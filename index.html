        <p>
          Artificial intelligence poses a range of emerging challenges, from
          labor market disruption to dual-use capabilities. Many of these can be
          addressed by shaping the consumption of AI capabilities in a
          coordinated way. This work focuses on facilitating coordinated action
          by enabling remote verification.

        <h2>Computational Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Enforcing coordinated capability controls could address many near-term
          challenges, yet what capabilities ought we cultivate in machines that
          may go on to shape the world? There's a case to be made that we ought
          to cultivate a tendency to reason about what ought to be done,
          irrespective of human values.
