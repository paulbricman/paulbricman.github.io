    This is a disambiguation page for my online presence. I'm using it as a
    common thread which weaves together various fragments of my identity into a
    unified whole. A digital mozaic of my ambitions and obsessions, interests
    and hobbies. That said, it's a mozaic that's slowly shifting over time, with
    the whole defined by the emergent pattern, not the individual fragments.
    It's essentially the result of a 20-year-old trying to orient himself and
    enjoy the process.
