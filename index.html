        <h2>Virtual Diplomacy</h2>
        <p>
          AI poses a range of emerging challenges, from labor market disruption
          to dual-use capabilities. Many of these can be addressed by shaping
          the consumption of AI capabilities in a coordinated way. This work
          focuses on facilitating coordinated action at domestic and
          international levels by enabling remote verification.

        <h2>Computational Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Enforcing coordinated capability controls could legibly address many
          near-term challenges, yet what capabilities ought we cultivate in
          machines that may go on to shape the cosmos? There's a case to be made
          that we ought to cultivate a tendency to reason about what ought to be
          done, irrespective of human values.
