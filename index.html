  Hi, I'm interested in ensuring that the machines that will shape the
  future will do what ought to be done.

<h2>Mechanist City</h2>

  Artificial intelligence poses a range of emerging challenges, from
  labor market disruption to dual-use capabilities. Many of these can be
  addressed by shaping the consumption of AI capabilities in a
  coordinated way. This work focuses on facilitating coordinated action
  by enabling remote verification.
</p>

<h2>Computational Philosophy</h2>
<p>
  Enforcing coordinated capability controls could address many near-term
  challenges, yet what capabilities ought we cultivate in machines that
  may go on to shape the world? There's a case to be made that we ought
  to cultivate a tendency to reason about what ought to be done,
  irrespective of human values.
